# React-Portfolio

Being a web developer means being part of a community. I will need a place to share my projects not only if im applying 
for jobs or working as a freelancer but also so that i can share my work 
with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects. 

## Introduction

With this react portfolio application i am able to demonstrate my skills to recruiters when applying to software development jobs;
Now that i've completed multiple projects, my task is to create a portfolio, using my new React skills to set me apart from other developers
whose portfolios donâ€™t use the latest technologies.

## User Story

AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Built With

    HTML
    CSS
    Javascript
    React
    React-dom
